# Unified UI/UX Standards

- All UI spacing, padding, margins, gaps, radii, and layout dimensions must use the 
  project's spacing and sizing tokens. No arbitrary values, no pixel-based hardcoding.

- All pages, components, and modules must follow the global spacing system:
    - consistent vertical rhythm
    - consistent horizontal spacing
    - consistent grid layout rules

- Card components, blocks, and sections must follow consistent:
    - border radius (from tokens)
    - padding structure
    - header/footer spacing
    - inner layout hierarchy
    - elevation/shadow (if applicable)

- Typography must use the project's unified font tokens:
    - heading sizes
    - body text sizes
    - weights
    - line heights
    - token-based styles only
  No custom inline fonts or ad-hoc styles.

- All icons must come from the project's approved icon set (UI kit or designated library).
  No custom SVG or random icons unless explicitly required.

- Every new page must automatically include:
    - the global Header component
    - the global Footer component
  with consistent spacing, alignment, and style.

- The header and footer must maintain:
    - identical spacing across all pages
    - consistent height
    - consistent typography
    - consistent iconography
    - consistent colors from tokens

- All page layouts must follow repository-wide layout conventions:
    - grid behavior
    - breakpoints
    - responsive logic
    - max-width containers
    - gutters and alignment

- Reuse existing components whenever possible.
  Do not create new UI wrappers, spacing blocks, layout containers, or card variants
  if they already exist.

- All new UI components must follow the repository's established:
    - naming conventions
    - folder structure
    - token usage rules
    - motion/animation presets
    - accessibility guidelines

- When generating new pages or modifying existing ones, 
  automatically adhere to the unified design system,
  applying global spacing, typography, motion, and layout patterns without exceptions.

- All visual elements must be theme-friendly, 
  using tokens and CSS variables that adapt to light/dark modes.
