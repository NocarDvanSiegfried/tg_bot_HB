# General Caching Rules

- Cache is a performance optimization layer, not a source of truth. 
  All authoritative data must live in permanent storage.

- Only cache data that:
    - is read frequently,
    - changes infrequently,
    - is expensive or slow to compute or retrieve.

- Every cached value must have a well-defined TTL (time-to-live).

- The system must remain functional even if the cache is empty, lost, or unavailable.

- Any change to the underlying data must trigger cache invalidation or refresh.

- Sensitive data must never be cached (personal info, passwords, tokens, private keys).

- Cache keys must follow a consistent and predictable naming pattern.

- Cache must not mirror the entire database schema. 
  Only cache results that improve performance meaningfully.

- Avoid over-caching: excessive caching consumes memory and complicates invalidation.

- Avoid too short TTLs: ineffective caching leads to little or no performance gain.

- Cache logic must remain simple, transparent, and predictable.

- When cache entries expire or are flushed, the system must automatically rebuild them on demand.

- Business-critical decisions must never rely solely on cached values.

- Caching must not change the behavior of the application — only speed it up.

- The application must assume cached data may become stale, missing, or evicted at any time.
