# Frontend Visualization & Media Rules

- All visualizations must be implemented using the project's approved charting library 
  (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js, ECharts, or another defined library). 
  No placeholder pseudo-visualizations.

- Every visualization component must:
    - import the charting library directly
    - use real data passed as props
    - render a visible chart element on the page
    - not rely on external images or screenshots from Figma

- When the user requests "show a graph / chart / visualization":
    - generate a React visualization component immediately
    - include full working JSX + dataset
    - include required imports
    - insert the component into the correct page or layout

- For images:
    - place them in the project's /public or /assets folder
    - reference them using static imports or absolute paths
    - do not rely on external URLs unless explicitly provided

- Figma designs must be interpreted verbally.
  Cursor must never depend on Figma links or attempt to fetch design files.

- When adding UI elements to the main menu:
    - integrate components directly into the existing layout
    - ensure the element is visible and styled with tokens
    - ensure imports and file locations exist

- If visualization data is missing, Cursor must generate a mock dataset.
